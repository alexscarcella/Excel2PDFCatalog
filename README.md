# Excel2PDFCatalog

Excel2PDFCatalog is a Python tool that reads product/catalog data from an Excel file and generates one PDF catalog. It provides a minimal UI to select the Excel file and image folders and a PDF builder that composes pages from rows and linked images.

## Purpose
Provide a fast, editable pipeline to generate printable/catalog PDFs from spreadsheet data and image folders. Intended for internal use and easy adaptation to different Excel layouts and output requirements.

## ✨ Key Features
- Excel import: reads Excel files via ***pandas/openpyxl*** with support for common Excel formats and multiple sheets.
- Column-to-field mapping: configurable mapping between Excel columns and product fields (title, description, price, image references).
- UI-driven workflow:
  - File pickers for Excel file, one or more image folders, and output folder.
  - Controls to load/save runtime configuration (***app/config.json***).
  - Simple "Go" button to start PDF generation and a console/log area showing progress and errors.
- PDF generation:
  - Uses reportlab to layout pages and render text and images.
  - Supports multiple images per product (searches configured image folders).
  - Image resizing and placement logic to fit images into product frames.
  - Customizable fonts (fonts/ folder) and basic styling via configuration.
- Config files:
  - ***app/config.json*** — runtime defaults (paths, page settings, logging).
  - ***Excel2PDFCatalog.config*** — project-specific mapping and rules for interpreting Excel rows.
- Error handling & logging: console output and log messages for missing images, parsing errors, and generation steps.
- Examples & assets:
  - ***example_excel/*** and ***example_catalog/*** provide sample inputs and outputs to validate layout and mapping.
- Portable & editable: code organized to allow quick changes to layout logic, mapping rules, or PDF styling.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**
- Dependencies listed in app/requirements.txt (notably: reportlab, pillow, pandas, openpyxl)

## 🚀 Installation & Run (Windows)

### 1. Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r app/requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the application
```bash
python Excel2PDFCatalog.py
```

👉 Alternatively, launch directly via VS Code using ``.vscode/launch.json``

## ⚙️ Configuration

``app/config.json`` → to set default folders, page size, and other runtime options.

``Excel2PDFCatalog.config`` → to change column mappings and product-level rules.

Edit these files to match your Excel layout, image folder structure, and output preferences.

```

## ▶️ Usage

1. Start the app.
2. Select an Excel file, the image folder(s) containing product images, and the output folder.
3. Verify or edit the column mapping if your Excel uses different headers.
4. Click "Go" to generate the PDF(s). Monitor the log/console for progress and warnings.

## 📄 Preview

An Excel file with columns Name, Price, Image can produce a PDF catalog with:

- Product title
- Formatted price
- Linked image from img_products/

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- Verify that image filenames referenced in Excel match actual files in the provided image folders.
- If an image is missing, the generator logs a warning and continues (placeholder behavior depends on config).
- Reinstall dependencies inside the active virtualenv if import errors occur.
- Check the VS Code terminal/output for full error traces when debugging.
